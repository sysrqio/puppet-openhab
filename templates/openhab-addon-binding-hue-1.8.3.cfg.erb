# Polling interval in msec to retrieve Philips bulb status.
# Other apps can change Hue status or a physical switch can turn on / off lamp status.
# If this happens the status of hue lamps within OpenHAB won't reflect the real status.
# Currently (September 2014) there is no push technology available, so the only option is
# to poll Philips bulbs to retrieve status and update items accordingly to reflect changes.
# Polling is enabled if refresh is specified, by commenting out "hue:refresh=10000" statement.
# Be aware that polling will consume resources, so a small refresh interval will increase cpu load.
# hue:refresh=10000
